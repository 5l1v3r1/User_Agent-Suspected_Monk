# User_Agent-Suspicious_Monk
Animation in Pure CSS3 and HTML5, the animation uses the User Agent to change the background depending on the browser

<p>For this animation I started from this project:
https://codepen.io/poziomq/pen/NbjZpG</p>

<p>The code is totally responsive and fits very well with every type of screen and device.<p>

<h3>Browser Compatibility:</h3>
<p>Chrome, Opera, Mozilla, IE, safari, Edge and Netscape Navigator (lol!!! it's a joke)</p>

<p>As usual Internet Explorer interprets the code in html5 very badly.</p>

<p>In Safari, however, the audio player is not displayed and the background made of gradients </br>is not read well (giving a background on red)</p>
